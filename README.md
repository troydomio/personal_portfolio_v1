Hello my name is Troy and this is the first version of my personal portfolio that is the home to all off my projects created using a variety of languages, frameworks and libraries such as:

* JavaScript
* React
* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* CSS
* HTML

As a graduate of Flatiron School's SE (software engineering 062821) program specializing in front-end web development, the aim of my portfolio is to showcase some of my favorites and archive my progression in skills over time. 

Thanks for stopping by!

Troy Akins
